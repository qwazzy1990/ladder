In their paper \textbf{Ladder-Lottery Realization} the authors provide 
a rather interesting puzzle in regards to ladder lotteries. The puzzle 
is known as the ladder-lottery realization problem. In order to understand
the problem, one must know what a \emph{multi-set} is. A \emph{multi-set}
is a set in which an element appears more than once. The exponent 
above the element indicates the number of times it appears in the set.
For example, given the following multi-set, $\{3^{2}, 2^{4}, 5^{1}\}$ 
the element $3$ appears twice in the set, the element $2$ appears four times
in the set and the element $5$ appears once in the set.
The ladder-lottery realization puzzle asks, given an arbitrary starting permutation 
and a multi-set of bars, 
is there a \emph{non-optimal} ladder lottery for the arbitrary permutation
that uses every bar in the multi-set the number 
of times it appears in the  multi-set. 
For an example of an affirmative solution to the ladder lottery realization problem, see figure --fig ref --.
