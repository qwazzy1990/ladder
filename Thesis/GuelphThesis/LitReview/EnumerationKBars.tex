\section{Efficient Enumeration of all Ladder Lotteries with K Bars}

In this paper, the authors apply the same algorithm used in Efficient Enumeration of Optimal Ladder-Lotteries 
and its Application for generating all ladder lotteries with k bars. The number of elements 
in The inversion set of $\pi$ also known as $Inv\{\pi\}$ provides the lower bound for $K$ 
and the upper bound is positive infinity. Therefore $K=[|Inv\{\pi\}| \dots N]$\par
