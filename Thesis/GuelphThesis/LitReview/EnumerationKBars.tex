\subsection{Efficient Enumeration of all Ladder Lotteries with K Bars}

In this paper, the authors apply the same algorithm used in Efficient Enumeration of Optimal Ladder-Lotteries 
and its Application for generating all ladder lotteries with k bars where the number of inversions in $\pi \leq K \leq +\infty$.
In other words, the authors use the algorithm in Efficient Enumeration of Optimal Ladder-Lotteries and its Application for generating 
non-optimal ladders.
