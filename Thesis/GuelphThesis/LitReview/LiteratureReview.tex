%%Intro to the Literature Review
\subsection{Literature Overview}
    The study of ladder lottieres as mathematical objects began in 2010, in  the paper
    \textbf{Efficient Enumeration of Ladder Lotteries and its Application}. The paper was 
    written by four authors, Yamanaka, Horiyama, Uno and Wasa. In this paper the 
    authors present an algorithm for generating all the ladder lotteries of an 
    arbitrary permutation, $\pi$. Since this paper emerged, there have been 
    several other paper written directly about ladder lotteries. 
    These papers include \textbf{The Ladder Lottery Realization Problem},
    \textbf{Optimal Reconfiguration of Optimal Ladder Lotteries}, 
    \textbf{Efficient Enumeration of all Ladder Lotteries with K Bars},
    \textbf{Coding Ladder Lotteries} and
    \textbf{Enumeration, Counting, and Random Generation of Ladder Lotteries}.

%%%section on how ladde lotteries relate to other mathematical objects
% Despite the fact that ladder lotteries have only been stuidied in and
% of themseleves for ten years, they are closely tied to other mathematical 
% phenomena that have been studied for much longer. These mathematical phenomena  
%  include \emph{Pseudo Lines} which are an arrangement of 
% curves on a plane such that given two curves, they only intersect 
% at most once and at each intersection, only two curves intersect.See figure --reference--
% for a wiring diagrams of the pseudo line arrangement for the 
% permutation, $(5,4,3,2,1)$. The other mathematical phenomena is \emph{adjacent transpositions}
% which is a swap of two adjacent elements in a permutation.
