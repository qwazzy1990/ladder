The study of ladder lottieres as mathematical objects began in 2010, in  the paper
\textbf{Efficient Enumeration of Ladder Lotteries and its Application}. The paper was 
written by four authors, Yamanaka, Horiyama, Uno and Wasa. In this paper the 
authors present an algorithm for generating all the ladder lotteries of an 
arbitrary permutation, $\pi$. Since this paper emerged, there have been 
several other paper written directly about ladder lotteries. 
These papers include \textbf{The Ladder Lottery Realization Problem},
\textbf{Optimal Reconfiguration of Optimal Ladder Lotteries}, 
\textbf{Efficient Enumeration of all Ladder Lotteries with K Bars},
\textbf{Coding Ladder Lotteries} and
\textbf{Enumeration, Counting, and Random Generation of Ladder Lotteries}.

%%%section on how ladde lotteries relate to other mathematical objects
Despite the fact that ladder lotteries have only been stuidied in and
of themseleves for ten years, they are closely tied to other mathematical 
phenomena that have been studied for much longer. These mathematical phenomena  
 include \emph{Pseudo Lines} which are an arrangement of 
curves on a plane such that given two curves, they only intersect 
at most once and at each intersection, only two curves intersect.See figure --reference--
for a wiring diagrams of the pseudo line arrangement for the 
permutation, $(5,4,3,2,1)$. The other mathematical phenomena is \emph{adjacent transpositions}
which is a swap of two adjacent elements in a permutation.
