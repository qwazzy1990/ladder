\subsection{Permutations}
Ladder-lotteries and permutations are intricately related to each other. In one of the main problems addressed in this thesis, The Listing Problem, 
the research for this problem primarily came from researching listing algorithms for permutations. Four of these 
permutation listing algorithms will be presented along with their influence on the listing algorithms for The Listing Problem 
pertaining to ladder-lotteries. These four permutation listing algorithms are Heap's algorithm, Zak's algorithm, Lexicographic algorithm 
and the Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter algorithm. 

\subsubsection{Heap's Algorithm}
Heap's algorithm was developed by B.R. Heap in 1963. The algorithm is based on rotating elements in an array such that the
