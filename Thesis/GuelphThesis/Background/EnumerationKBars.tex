\section{Efficient Enumeration of all Ladder Lotteries with K Bars}

In Efficient Enumeration of all Ladder Lotteries with K Bars, written by Nakano and Yamanaka, the authors apply the same algorithm used in 
Efficient Enumeration of Optimal Ladder Lotteries 
and its Application for generating all ladder lotteries with $k$ bars where the number of inversions in $\pi \leq k \leq +\infty$.
In other words, the authors use the algorithm in Efficient Enumeration of Optimal Ladder Lotteries and its Application for generating 
non-optimal ladders~\cite{A4}.
