
In the background section we will provide a more comprehensive analysis of the existing research surrounding ladder lotteries. 
We will also go through the foundational concepts, algorithms and proofs that act as the backbone for the 
results  in chapters three and four. 
The study of ladder lottieres as mathematical objects began in 2010, in the paper
Efficient Enumeration of Ladder Lotteries and its Application, written by Matsui, Nakada, Nakano Uehara and Yamanaka \cite{A1}. 
    In this paper the authors present the first algorithm for generating $OptL\{\pi\}$ for some  
    arbitrary permutation $\pi$. Since this paper emerged, there have been 
    several other papers written about ladder lotteries. 
    These papers include The Ladder Lottery Realization Problem,
    Optimal Reconfiguration of Optimal Ladder Lotteries, 
    Efficient Enumeration of all Ladder Lotteries with K Bars,
    Coding Ladder Lotteries and
    Enumeration, Counting, and Random Generation of Ladder Lotteries.
