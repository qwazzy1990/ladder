%%%section on how ladde lotteries relate to other mathematical objects
% Despite the fact that ladder lotteries have only been stuidied in and
% of themseleves for ten years, they are closely tied to other mathematical 
% phenomena that have been studied for much longer. These mathematical phenomena  
%  include \emph{Pseudo Lines} which are an arrangement of 
% curves on a plane such that given two curves, they only intersect 
% at most once and at each intersection, only two curves intersect.See figure --reference--
% for a wiring diagrams of the pseudo line arrangement for the 
% permutation, $(5,4,3,2,1)$. The other mathematical phenomena is \emph{adjacent transpositions}
% which is a swap of two adjacent elements in a permutation.
