\section{Efficient Enumeration of Ladder Lotteries and its Application}

%%Intro
In the Efficient Enumeration of Ladder Lotteries and its Application~\cite{A1}, written by Yamanaka, Nakano, Matsui, Uehara, and Nakada, 
the authors provide an algorithm for generating $OptL\{\pi\}$ 
for any $\pi$, in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time per ladder. The authors refer to this algorithm as {\sc FindAllChildren}.

{\sc FindAllChildren} was used in this thesis to generate the sample data that aided in finding solutions for 
the Canonical Ladder Listing Problem.
To see the tree structure generated by {\sc FindAllChildren} for $OptL\{(4,3,2,1)\}$ 
please refer to Figure~\ref{Fig:TreeFAC}.\par

Let $x>y>z$ be any three elements in $\pi$. 
Let $pos(x) < pos(z)$ and let $pos(y) < pos(z)$. 
Let $l$ be a ladder lottery in $OptL\{\pi\}$. 
Let $(x,z)$ be a  bar in $l$. Let $(y,z)$ 
be a bar in $l$. We say the \emph{clean level} of $l$ is $1$ 
plus the maximum value of $x$ for which the following property holds: $\exists (x,z) \text{ below } (y,z) \in l$. 
Then, we say the clean level is $x+1$. If no such $x$ exists, we say the clean level of a ladder is $1$. 
Yamanaka, Nakano, Matsui, Uehara, and Nakada show that the ladder with a clean level of $1$ is unique in $OptL\{\pi\}$. This ladder 
is known as the \emph{root ladder}. The authors do not provide an algorithm for creating the root ladder. 
Coincidentally, the algorithm {\sc CreateCanonical} found in Chapter 3 also creates the root ladder for $OptL\{\pi\}$. 
Hence, we provide the algorithm for creating the root ladder.
To see the root ladder of $OptL\{(4,5,6,3,1,2)\}$ please refer to figure Figure~\ref{fig:root}, which we note has a clean level of $1$.
