
In this chapter we will provide a more comprehensive analysis of the existing research surrounding ladder lotteries. Let {\sc x} be 
a ladder lottery or permutation. 
Throughout this thesis a number of algorithms are presented. Many of these algorithms use the following auxiliary functions: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item {\sc Print(x)}: Prints {\sc x}.
    \item {\sc Swap}($p_{i}$,$p_{j}$): Swaps $p_{i}$ and $p_{j}$ which are two elements in a permutation.
    \item {\sc Sort(x)}: Sorts {\sc x} in ascending order.
    \item {\sc Sorted(x)}: Returns true if {\sc x} is sorted in ascending order, else returns false.
    \item {\sc Max(x)}: Returns the maximum element in {\sc x}.
    \item {\sc Min(x)}: Returns the minimum element in {\sc x}.
\end{enumerate}

The study of ladder lotteries as mathematical objects began in 2010, in the paper
\emph{Efficient Enumeration of Ladder Lotteries and its Application}, written by Matsui, Nakada, Nakano Uehara and Yamanaka~\cite{A1}. 
In this paper the authors present the first algorithm for generating $OptL\{\pi\}$ for some  
arbitrary permutation $\pi$. Since this paper emerged, there have been 
a number of other papers written about ladder lotteries.
These papers include \emph{The Ladder Lottery Realization Problem}~\cite{A3},
\emph{Optimal Reconfiguration of Optimal Ladder Lotteries}~\cite{A2}, 
\emph{Efficient Enumeration of all Ladder Lotteries with K Bars}~\cite{A4},
\emph{Coding Ladder Lotteries}~\cite{A5} and
\emph{Enumeration, Counting, and Random Generation of Ladder Lotteries}~\cite{A6}.
This thesis is also heavily influenced by \emph{Efficient Enumeration of Ladder Lotteries and its Application}~\cite{A1}. Throughout Chapter 2, 
we elaborate on the aforementioned papers pertaining to ladder lotteries.
