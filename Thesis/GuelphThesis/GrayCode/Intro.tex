Listing problems are common problems in combinatorics. In general, listing problems 
focus on enumerating the objects of a given finite set in some specific order. The listing problem in this thesis 
will be termed \emph{The Canonical Ladder Listing Problem}. This problem asks, given all $n!$ permutations of order $n$, is there an efficient algorithm for listing 
one optimal ladder per permutation? In other words, is there an easy way to transition from one ladder to the next until all $n!$ ladders 
have been listed? The problem is stated as follows: Let $S_{n}$ be the set of all $n!$ permutations of order $n$. 
Let the \emph{canonical representative} be the root ladder from each permutation's corresponding $OptL\{\pi\}$. Let $L_{n}$ be the set of 
all $n!$ root ladders. A minimal \emph{change} 
is defined as the insertion or deletion of at most two bars between any two subsequent ladders in $L_{n}$. The goal is 
to create $L_{n}$ with minimal change in an efficient manner.\par
In this thesis, two listing algorithms are used to list $L_{n}$. The first of these listing algorithms 
is a modification of the {\sc Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter} permutation listing algorithm~\cite{A25}.
This algorithm is termed {\sc ModifiedSJT}.
The second listing algorithm is influenced by Effler and Ruskey's algorithm~\cite{A26}. 
This second ladder listing algorithm is termed the {\sc CyclicBar} algorithm. Both of these algorithms will 
be described, explained and analyzed throughout the remainder of the chapter.\par
Before proceeding, the selection process for choosing the canonical ladder will be explained.
The reason the root ladder is chosen to be the canonical representative is because 
when transitioning between root ladders, a minimal amount of change is required 
to go from one ladder to the next. Also, the root ladder is unique to each 
$OptL\{\pi\}$ seeing as it is the only ladder in $OptL\{\pi\}$ with a clean level of one. 
Furthermore, is the root of the tree generated by {\sc FindAllChildren}, 
thus making it the most important ladder in the tree. All these factors make the root ladder 
the ideal candidate for the canonical representative.
