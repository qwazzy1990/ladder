abstract = "A ladder lottery, known as “Amidakuji” in Japan, is a common way to choose a permutation randomly. A ladder lottery L corresponding to a given permutation π is optimal if L has the minimum number of horizontal lines among the ladder lotteries corresponding to π. In this paper we show that for any two optimal ladder lotteries L1 and L2 of a permutation, there exists a sequence of local modifications which transforms L1 into L2. We also give an algorithm to enumerate all optimal ladder lotteries of a given permutation. By setting π=(n,n−1,…,1), the algorithm enumerates all arrangements of n pseudolines efficiently. By implementing the algorithm we compute the number of arrangements of n pseudolines for each n≤11."

Abstract = {The subject of this book is the action of permutation groups on sets associated with combinatorial structures. Each chapter deals with a particular structure: groups, geometries, designs, graphs and maps respectively. A unifying theme for the first four chapters is the construction of finite simple groups. In the fifth chapter, a theory of maps on orientable surfaces is developed within a combinatorial framework. This simplifies and extends the existing literature in the field. The book is designed both as a course text and as a reference book for advanced undergraduate and graduate students. A feature is the set of carefully constructed projects, intended to give the reader a deeper understanding of the subject.},

@book{A15,
Abstract = {Permutation groups are one of the oldest topics in algebra. However, their study has recently been revolutionised by new developments, particularly the classification of finite simple groups, but also relations with logic and combinatorics, and importantly, computer algebra systems have been introduced that can deal with large permutation groups. This book gives a summary of these developments, including an introduction to relevant computer algebra systems, sketch proofs of major theorems, and many examples of applying the classification of finite simple groups. It is aimed at beginning graduate students and experts in other areas, and grew from a short course at the EIDMA institute in Eindhoven.},

Résumé
Avant L. Fibonacci (env. 1202 ap. J. C.), Virahanka (entre 600 et 800 ap. J. C.), Gopala (avant 1135 ap. J. C.), et Hemacandra (env. 1150 ap. J. C.) intruidisirent les nombres de Fibonacci ainsi qu'une méthode de les générer. Narayana Pandita (1356 ap. J. C.) établit une relation entre son samasika-pankti, dont les nombres de Fibonacci sont un cas particulier, et les “coefficients multinomiaux.”
Zusammenfassung
Die gewöhnlich nach Fibonacci bezeichnete Zahlenfolge wie auch deren Bildungsgesetz wurden von Virahanka (zwischen 600 und 800 nach Christus), Gopala (vor 1135), und Hemacandra (um 1150) angegeben, die alle früher als L. Fibonacci (um 1202) lebten. Narayanȧ Panḋita (1356) fand eine Beziehung zwischen seinen samasika-paṅkti, worin die Fibonacci-Zahlen als Sonderfall enthalten sind, und den “multinomialen Koeffizienten.”"

abstract = "In this paper we solve the open problem of designing a cost-optimal parallel algorithm for generating permutations ofMelements out of the set {0, 1, …,N− 1}, in lexicographic order. Our algorithm runs on the simplest model of parallel computation, i.e., a linear array of sizeM, where each processor PE(i) needs only a constant number of words of length logN, and is responsible for producing with constant delay, theith components in the successive permutations. This algorithm runs in timeO(N!/(N−M)!) on an array of sizeMand is therefore cost-optimal when the time needed to output the permutations is taken into account. Moreover, by doubling the number of cells, it is possible to implement this algorithm on a unidirectional linear array."
