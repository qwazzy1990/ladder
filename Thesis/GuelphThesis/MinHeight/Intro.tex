\subsection{Introduction To The Problem}
The Minimum Height Problem is a unique problem to ladder-lotteries, but when the problem is generalized it can be 
looked at as an optimization problem. The Minimum Height Problem asks, given $OptL\{\pi_{N}\}$, what is the 
ladder(s) in the set with the minimal number of rows? Furthermore, is there an algorithm for creating the ladder(s)
with the minimal number of rows? Some tangential questions that result from this problem are the following. Firstly, 
is there an upper and lower limit for the minimal height of a ladder from $OptL\{\pi_{N}\}$? Secondly, do different 
permutaions of the same order $N$ result in
