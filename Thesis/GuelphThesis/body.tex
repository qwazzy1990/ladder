\section{Thesis Statement}
    This thesis provides four full, or partial, solutions to four problems related 
    to ladder-lotteries. The first of these problems is the so called counting problem,, 
    which asks, how many ladders are in $OptL\{\pi\}$? This thesis provides 
    a formula for the exact number of ladders in $OptL\{\pi\}$, for certain 
    cases of $\pi$ as well as a general recurrence relation for $OptL\{\pi\}$
    when $\pi$ is the decending permutation. The second problem is the so called minimum height 
    problem which asks, given all the ladders in $Optl\{\pi\}$, which ladder(s) are 
    the shortest, that is to say which ladders have the smallest height? This thesis 
    provides a theorem as to which ladder(s) in $OptL\{\pi\}$ have the shortest heights.
    The third problem is the so called canonical ladder generation problem. 
    This problem asks, given all permutations of size $N$, is there a Gray Code 
    to generate a canonical ladder from each permutation's $OptL\{\pi\}$? In other words, 
    is there an easy way to transition from one permutation's canonical ladder to the next 
    permutation's canonical ladder until all permutations of size $N$ have had their canonical 
    ladder generated. This thesis provides such a Gray Code. The last problem is the so called encoding problem.
    The encoding problem asks, given a ladder-lottery, provide an optimal compact 
    representation of said ladder-lottery. This thesis provides an encoding for ladder-lotteries.
\section{Overview of Thesis}  

This thesis is broken down into several sections. Firstly, an introuduction to Amidakuji, 
and how they pertain to computer science will be presented. This will be followed by a literature 
review of ladder lotteries in which discussions of solved problems will be 
provided, along with the commonalities between ladder lotteries and 
other mathematical objects. Following the literature review, the methodology
used to conduct the research will be discussed. This section will focus 
primarily on the algorithms used to generate the data for this reasearch. 
Following the methodology section, the findings of the research will be discussed and analyzed. 
In this section there will be proofs and formulas for certain propositions made about ladder 
lotteries. This section will contain the bulk of the findings for this thesis.
Following the results section, a summary of future work will be provided. In this section,
the failures and successes of this research will be analyzed. There will also be commentary on 
open (unsolved) problems related to ladder lotteries and a 
discussion of how research on ladder lotteries could be used in other fields.
Finally, a conlcusion that summarizes the thesis will be provided.
