\section{Thesis Statement}  
This thesis presents solutions to three problems surrounding ladder lotteries.
The problems that this thesis presents solutions to are firstly the counting problem, secondly the minimial height problem and thirdly 
the problem of creating a Gray Code for generating canonical ladders within different sets
of ladder lotteries. 
\section{Overview of Thesis}  

This thesis is broken down into several sections. Firstly, an introuduction to ladder
lotteries, and how they pertain to computer science will be presented. This will be followed by a literature 
review of ladder lotteries in which discussions of solved problems will be 
provided, along with the commonalities between ladder lotteries and 
other mathematical objects. Following the literature review, the methodology
used to conduct the research will be discussed. This section will focus 
primarily on the algorithms used to generate the data for this reasearch. 
Following the methodology section, the findings of the research will be discussed and analyzed. In this section
there will be proofs and formulas for certain propositions made about ladder 
lotteries. This section will be the bulk of the findings for this thesis.
Following the results section, a summary of future work will be provided. In this section, an 
of the failures and successes of this research will be analyzed. There will also be commentary on 
open (unsolved) problems related to ladder lotteries and a 
discussion of how research on ladder lotteries could be used in other fields.
Finally a conlcusion that summarizes the thesis will be provided.
