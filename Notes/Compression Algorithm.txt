My own compression algorithm for a ladder is based off of the heights of the ladder.
Based off of the idea that a bar's height can be moved up or down so long as 
there is no endpoint of some other bar between it and a bar below it.

Equivelent heights are a set of possible heights belonging to a bar 
such that a bar can occupy any of the heights and the ladder will not change. 

There is a height for bar x such that the number of lines for this height is at most 2* the number of bars 
at that height. All bars should be moved to this height. 

A bar can be moved in order to fulfill the above condition unless the bars are extreme.That is to say, 
two bars share a height, are more than one column apart and belong to the route of N and 2. 
This is because they  have nothing left in their height set to move up or down to.
