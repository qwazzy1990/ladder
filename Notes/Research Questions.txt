Q1: What is the upper limit for the number of heights for a given permutation and it's root ladder?
Q2: What is the gray code for generating ladder lotteries for the permutation of a sequence of {1, 2, ...,n}
Q3: How many ladder lotteries are there for a given number of inversions? If two permutations have the same number
of inversions do they have the same number of ladder lotteries?

The number of ladders for a given permutation is equal to the number of times each bar is swapped + 1.
A bar is swapped iff a bar is the bottom bar of a degenerative triadic sub-pattern. The number of times the 
bar is swapped is still unknown. A bar is part of at least 1 degenerative triadic sub-pattern if said bar represents
an inversion which is part of a degenerative triadic subsequence in the original permutation. 
A degenerative triadic subsequence is defined as follows. Given exactly three values, a , b and c, in a permutation of 
size N, such that a > b > c, value a is to the left of value b in the permutation, 
and value b is to the left of value c in the permutation.


The number of heights, given a number of inversions, for a given ladder, is determined by the position of the bars.
The bars are determined by the inversions. If there is only 1 inversion then there is only 1 height created with
exactly 1 inversion created by exactly 2 elements. If the number of inversions is equal to 2, then the number of
elements responsible for these inversions is either 3 or 4. If the number is 3, then the number of heights required
is 2 since the bars have to be adjascent to each other in the ladder. If the number is 4, then only 2 
heights are reuired because the bars cannot be adjascent to each other. 





Key Point: The number of times a bar crosses a given route N is the same for every permutation of the degenerative case.
For example, given 4 degenerative permutations, 7654321, 654321, 54321, 4321, the bar [2 1] crosses the route 3 once, regardless 
of the permutation.
